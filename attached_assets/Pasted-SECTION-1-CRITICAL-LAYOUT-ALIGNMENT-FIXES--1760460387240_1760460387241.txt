SECTION 1: CRITICAL LAYOUT & ALIGNMENT FIXES
================================================================================

ISSUE 1.2: FULLPAGE SCROLL SNAP SECTION HEIGHT INCONSISTENCY
-------------------------------------------------------------
Current State:
- Sections use "fullpage-section" class with snap-start
- Height is calculated using CSS variable "--fullpage-section-h"
- Mobile browsers have viewport height jumping issues with 100vh

Resolution Steps:
1. Locate where "--fullpage-section-h" CSS variable is defined
2. Check if it's using "100vh" which causes mobile browser issues
3. Replace viewport height calculation approach:
   - Create JavaScript function to calculate actual viewport height
   - Account for mobile browser UI (address bar, nav bar)
   - Use "100dvh" (dynamic viewport height) if browser supports it
   - Fallback to JavaScript-calculated height for older browsers
4. Set the calculated height value to the CSS variable on:
   - Initial page load
   - Window resize events
   - Orientation change events
5. For mobile-specific fix:
   - Detect if user is on mobile device
   - Calculate viewport height in pixels: window.innerHeight
   - Set this pixel value as inline style or CSS variable
   - This prevents the "jumping" effect when mobile browser UI appears/disappears


ISSUE 1.3: HORIZONTAL REEL SCROLL ALIGNMENT PROBLEMS
----------------------------------------------------
Current State:
- Three separate reel components (Hero, QuickActions, Testimonials)
- Each reel has horizontal scroll with snap-x snap-mandatory
- Slide widths use percentage-based flex-basis (33.3333%)
- Potential misalignment on different screen sizes

Resolution Steps:
1. Review QuickActionsReel and TestimonialsReel slide width calculations
2. For desktop (3 slides visible):
   - Verify each slide width is exactly 33.3333% of container
   - Ensure no additional padding/margin causes overflow
   - Check if scrollbar-width: none is properly hiding scrollbar
3. For tablet (2 slides visible):
   - Slides should be 50% width
   - Verify media query breakpoints are consistent
4. For mobile (1 slide visible):
   - Slides should be 100% width
   - Ensure full-bleed appearance
5. Fix common alignment issues:
   - Remove any conflicting padding on reel container
   - Ensure parent container has defined width
   - Check for box-sizing: border-box on all elements
   - Verify no flex-shrink or flex-grow is interfering
   - Test scroll snap points align with slide boundaries


ISSUE 1.4: SECTION NAVIGATION DOTS ALIGNMENT
--------------------------------------------
Current State:
- Right-side navigation dots use fixed positioning
- Transform translate-y-1/2 to center vertically
- Hidden on mobile (hidden md:flex)

Resolution Steps:
1. Verify the dots correctly map to actual sections (currently 3 sections)
2. Check vertical centering calculation:
   - Should account for topbar and mainnav heights
   - May need to adjust top: 50% calculation
3. For mobile, consider adding alternative progress indicator:
   - Bottom-fixed progress bar showing scroll depth
   - Or small dot indicators at bottom center
   - Should not obstruct main content
4. Ensure dot click handlers correctly scroll to sections:
   - Should use smooth scrolling behavior
   - Must account for scroll-snap interference
   - Verify correct section indices in event handlers


ISSUE 1.5: GRID LAYOUT HERO SECTION MISALIGNMENT
-------------------------------------------------
Current State:
- Hero section uses grid-cols-12 layout
- Left content: col-span-7, Right image: col-span-5
- May not be responsive properly

Resolution Steps:
1. Review hero section on various screen widths
2. Check if 7/5 column split works on all breakpoints
3. For tablet sizes, consider adjusting to:
   - Equal split (6/6) or single column layout
4. Ensure image doesn't overflow on smaller screens:
   - Set max-width and max-height constraints
   - Use object-fit if needed
5. Verify text content doesn't overflow at narrow widths:
   - Check heading font size scales appropriately
   - Ensure button group wraps gracefully
   - Test with longer text content


================================================================================
SECTION 2: COLOR CONTRAST & ACCESSIBILITY FIXES
================================================================================

ISSUE 2.1: POOR TEXT CONTRAST IN HERO SECTION
----------------------------------------------
Current State:
- White text on dark gradient background (gray-800 → gray-900 → gray-950)
- Subtitle text has opacity: 0.8 (text-surface/80)
- Stats text has opacity: 0.7 (text-surface/70)
- May fail WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text)

Resolution Steps:
1. Locate hero section text elements with reduced opacity
2. Increase opacity values:
   - Change "text-surface/80" to "text-surface/90" or "text-surface"
   - Change "text-surface/70" to "text-surface/80" minimum
3. Test contrast ratios using browser dev tools or online checkers
4. Target contrast ratios:
   - Large text (18pt+): minimum 3:1 for AA
   - Normal text: minimum 4.5:1 for AA
   - Aim for 7:1 for AAA compliance
5. If contrast still insufficient:
   - Lighten the background gradient slightly
   - Or remove opacity entirely from text
   - Or add text-shadow for better readability


ISSUE 2.2: BUTTON STYLING INCONSISTENCY
---------------------------------------
Current State:
- Primary CTA buttons have different padding across sections
- Hero section: px-8 py-4 (larger)
- QuickActions section: px-5 py-2 (smaller)
- Inconsistent minimum touch target sizes

Resolution Steps:
1. Standardize all primary CTA button classes:
   - Use consistent padding: px-6 py-3 (medium) or px-8 py-4 (large)
   - Ensure minimum 44x44px touch target for mobile accessibility
2. Create reusable button component classes:
   - Define primary, secondary, and tertiary button styles
   - Establish small, medium, large size variants
   - Document which variant to use where
3. Apply consistent styles to all CTAs:
   - "Get Instant Quote" button
   - "Shop Accessories" button  
   - "Book Now" buttons in repair cards
   - "View all repair services" link
4. Verify hover states are consistent:
   - All use same transition timing
   - Same hover color transformations
   - Consistent focus ring appearance


ISSUE 2.3: MISSING FOCUS INDICATORS
-----------------------------------
Current State:
- Testimonial cards don't show focus state for keyboard navigation
- Some interactive elements lack visible focus rings
- May fail keyboard accessibility requirements

Resolution Steps:
1. Add focus-visible styles to all interactive elements:
   - Testimonial cards
   - Repair service cards
   - Navigation dots
   - All buttons and links
2. Use Tailwind classes for consistent focus styling:
   - focus:ring-2 focus:ring-secondary
   - focus:ring-offset-2
   - focus:outline-none (only if adding custom focus style)
3. Test keyboard navigation flow:
   - Tab through all interactive elements
   - Ensure focus order is logical (top to bottom, left to right)
   - Verify focus is visible on all interactive elements
   - Test with screen reader if possible
4. For card components without native focus:
   - Add tabindex="0" to make focusable
   - Add focus-within styles to parent container
   - Ensure ARIA labels are present and descriptive


================================================================================
SECTION 3: MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS IMPROVEMENTS
================================================================================

ISSUE 3.1: MISSING MOBILE PROGRESS INDICATOR
--------------------------------------------
Current State:
- Section navigation dots are hidden on mobile (hidden md:flex)
- No way for mobile users to see position in page or total sections
- Poor UX for understanding page length

Resolution Steps:
1. Add mobile-specific progress indicator at bottom of screen:
   - Position: fixed, bottom: 80px (above mobile nav if present)
   - Width: full screen minus padding
   - Height: 2-4px thin line
2. Calculate progress percentage:
   - Current section index / total sections
   - Or scroll position / total scroll height
3. Visual style:
   - Background: light gray (bg-gray-200)
   - Progress bar: secondary color (bg-secondary)
   - Smooth transition on progress change
4. Hide on desktop (md:hidden class)
5. Ensure doesn't overlap with any footer or bottom-fixed elements


ISSUE 3.2: MOBILE VIEWPORT HEIGHT HANDLING
------------------------------------------
Current State:
- Sections use fullpage-section with viewport-based height
- Mobile browser UI (address bar) causes height changes during scroll
- Creates jarring "jump" effect on iOS Safari and Chrome

Resolution Steps:
1. Implement dynamic viewport height calculation:
   - On page load, measure window.innerHeight
   - Store in CSS custom property: --vh
   - Use calc(var(--vh, 1vh) * 100) instead of 100vh
2. Update height on relevant events:
   - Window resize
   - Orientation change
   - Scroll (throttled to avoid performance issues)
3. For devices that support new CSS units:
   - Use 100dvh (dynamic viewport height) with fallback
   - Feature detect: @supports (height: 100dvh)
4. Mobile-specific considerations:
   - iOS Safari: Use 100svh (small viewport height) for consistent height
   - Android Chrome: Dynamic units work better
   - Provide fallback for older browsers


ISSUE 3.3: TOUCH TARGET SIZE COMPLIANCE
---------------------------------------
Current State:
- Some interactive elements may be smaller than 44x44px minimum
- Navigation dots, carousel indicators need verification
- Violates mobile accessibility guidelines

Resolution Steps:
1. Audit all interactive elements for touch target size:
   - All buttons and CTAs
   - Section navigation dots
   - Carousel slide indicators
   - Social media icons in footer
   - Navigation menu items
2. Apply min-w-[44px] min-h-[44px] to elements:
   - Already applied to some buttons (good)
   - Ensure applied consistently to all interactive elements
3. For small visual elements (like dots):
   - Keep visual size small for aesthetics
   - Increase clickable/tappable area using padding
   - Or use pseudo-elements for larger hit area
4. Test on actual mobile devices:
   - Verify all elements are easily tappable
   - Check spacing between adjacent interactive elements
   - Ensure no accidental taps on wrong elements


================================================================================
SECTION 4: SCROLL BEHAVIOR OPTIMIZATIONS
================================================================================

ISSUE 4.1: SCROLL SNAP "JUMPING" BEHAVIOR
-----------------------------------------
Current State:
- scroll-snap-type: mandatory on main container
- May cause abrupt snapping that feels jarring
- Potential conflicts with section navigation dots

Resolution Steps:
1. Consider changing snap-type from "mandatory" to "proximity":
   - Allows smoother scroll experience
   - Still snaps when close to section boundary
   - Less aggressive than mandatory
2. Add scroll-margin to sections if needed:
   - Accounts for fixed header height
   - Prevents content hiding behind header
   - Use scroll-margin-top: calc(var(--topbar-h) + var(--navbar-h))
3. Implement scroll-snap-stop: always on first and last sections:
   - Prevents accidentally skipping first/last section
   - Allows easier scrolling through middle sections
4. Fine-tune snap sensitivity:
   - Test on various devices and browsers
   - Adjust based on user feedback
   - Consider disabling snap on trackpad/mouse scroll


ISSUE 4.2: CAROUSEL SCROLL INTERFERENCE
---------------------------------------
Current State:
- Horizontal scroll carousels (reels) within vertical scroll page
- Potential for scroll direction conflicts
- User may accidentally trigger wrong scroll axis

Resolution Steps:
1. Improve scroll axis locking in horizontal reels:
   - Increase horizontal scroll sensitivity threshold
   - Reduce vertical scroll capture in horizontal zones
2. Add visual cues for horizontal scroll:
   - Show partial next slide (peek effect)
   - Add arrow indicators on hover (desktop)
   - Swipe hint for mobile users
3. Implement touch gesture optimization:
   - For carousels: lock to horizontal after first move
   - Allow vertical override if user scrolls mostly vertical
   - Add momentum scrolling for natural feel
4. Test thoroughly on:
   - iOS Safari (often problematic with nested scroll)
   - Android Chrome
   - Desktop browsers with trackpad
   - Desktop browsers with mouse wheel


ISSUE 4.3: PROGRAMMATIC SCROLL CONFLICTS
----------------------------------------
Current State:
- Section navigation dots trigger programmatic scrolling
- May conflict with snap behavior and user scrolling
- Needs smooth scroll implementation

Resolution Steps:
1. Implement smooth scroll for navigation dot clicks:
   - Use Element.scrollIntoView() with behavior: 'smooth'
   - Or use custom scroll animation for more control
2. Disable snap temporarily during programmatic scroll:
   - Remove scroll-snap-type when navigation clicked
   - Re-enable after scroll animation completes
   - Use setTimeout or scroll event listener to detect end
3. Handle scroll interruption gracefully:
   - If user scrolls during animation, cancel programmatic scroll
   - Allow user input to always take priority
   - Clean up any pending scroll animations
4. Account for scroll-behavior CSS property:
   - May already have smooth scrolling enabled
   - Check for conflicts with JavaScript animations
   - Choose one approach (CSS or JS) for consistency


================================================================================
SECTION 5: PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS
================================================================================

ISSUE 5.1: REMOVE DEVELOPMENT CONSOLE LOGS
------------------------------------------
Current State:
- 19 console.log statements present in production code
- Performance overhead from logging
- Unprofessional in production environment

Resolution Steps:
1. Create environment-aware logging utility:
   - Check if process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
   - Only log in development mode
   - Silent in production builds
2. Replace all console.log with utility function:
   - Search for "console.log" in Index.jsx and reel components
   - Replace with devLog() or similar wrapper
   - Keep error logging (console.error) for production
3. Remove scroll debugging logs:
   - Lines logging scroll events, section changes, touch handlers
   - These are primary performance culprits
   - Only needed during development
4. Configure build tool to strip console statements:
   - Vite/Webpack can remove console.* in production
   - Add to build configuration as safety net
   - Verify in production bundle that logs are removed


ISSUE 5.2: IMAGE OPTIMIZATION
-----------------------------
Current State:
- Phone illustration loaded as PNG
- Has lazy loading (good) but no responsive images
- No modern format support (WebP/AVIF)
- No blur-up placeholder for better perceived performance

Resolution Steps:
1. Generate multiple image sizes:
   - Small: 480px width for mobile
   - Medium: 768px width for tablet  
   - Large: 1200px width for desktop
2. Convert images to modern formats:
   - Create AVIF version (best compression)
   - Create WebP version (fallback)
   - Keep PNG as final fallback
3. Implement responsive image markup:
   - Use <picture> element with multiple <source>
   - Add srcset with different sizes
   - Add sizes attribute for browser hints
4. Add blur-up placeholder:
   - Generate tiny base64-encoded version (20-50 bytes)
   - Show as background while image loads
   - Transition to full image when loaded
5. Verify lazy loading configuration:
   - Ensure loading="lazy" is present
   - Consider eager loading for above-fold images
   - Test that images load at appropriate times


ISSUE 5.3: PREVENT LAYOUT SHIFT (CLS)
-------------------------------------
Current State:
- Images and dynamic content may cause layout shift
- Affects Core Web Vitals score
- Poor user experience

Resolution Steps:
1. Reserve space for images before load:
   - Set explicit width and height attributes
   - Or use aspect-ratio CSS property
   - Prevents content jumping when image loads
2. For testimonial cards:
   - Set minimum height on card container
   - Prevents height changes as content loads
   - Use skeleton loader if dynamic content
3. For carousel slides:
   - Pre-calculate slide heights
   - Set explicit heights on containers
   - Prevent layout shift during carousel initialization
4. Test with Lighthouse:
   - Run Lighthouse audit in Chrome DevTools
   - Check Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) score
   - Target CLS < 0.1 for good score
   - Identify and fix largest shift sources


================================================================================

   - Scroll behavior and snap points
   - Any parent container requirements
3. Document utility functions:
   - Scroll calculation functions
   - Event handler purposes
   - Any non-obvious logic
4. Add inline comments for complex sections:
   - Touch event handlers
   - Scroll position calculations
   - Section navigation logic


ISSUE 6.2: ESTABLISH NAMING CONVENTIONS
---------------------------------------
Current State:
- Mixed naming styles throughout codebase
- Inconsistent between CSS classes and JavaScript

Resolution Steps:
1. Document and enforce naming conventions:
   - CSS classes: kebab-case (e.g., "hero-section")
   - JavaScript variables/functions: camelCase (e.g., "scrollToSection")
   - React components: PascalCase (e.g., "HeroReel")
   - Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., "REEL_CONFIG")
2. Refactor existing code to follow conventions:
   - Update variable names consistently
   - Rename files if needed for consistency
   - Update imports/exports accordingly
3. Add linting rules to enforce:
   - ESLint rules for JavaScript naming
   - Stylelint for CSS naming
   - Configure in .eslintrc and .stylelintrc
4. Document conventions in project README or style guide


ISSUE 6.3: CREATE REUSABLE COMPONENTS
-------------------------------------
Current State:
- Button styles duplicated across components
- Card layouts repeated with slight variations

   - Consistent padding, min-height, font-size
   - Export from common/Button.jsx
2. Create shared Card component:
   - Standard padding, border-radius, shadow
   - Support different card types (testimonial, service, etc.)
   - Consistent hover effects
3. Create LoadingSkeleton component:
   - Placeholder for cards while loading
   - Matches card dimensions and structure
   - Smooth animation
4. Organize in components folder structure:
   - components/common/ for shared components
   - components/reels/ for carousel sections
   - components/layout/ for page structure

   - Text wrapping and overflow
   - Image scaling and aspect ratios
   - Button and card sizing
   - Navigation behavior at different sizes
   - Carousel slides per view transitions
4. Use browser DevTools:
   - Device emulation mode
   - Responsive design mode
   - Test orientation changes
   - Verify touch event simulation


ISSUE 10.3: ACCESSIBILITY AUDIT
-------------------------------
Current State:
- Unknown WCAG compliance level
- Need formal accessibility audit

Resolution Steps:
1. Run automated accessibility scanners:
   - Lighthouse audit in Chrome DevTools
   - axe DevTools browser extension
   - WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)
2. Test keyboard navigation:
   - Verify tab order is logical
   - Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
   - Test Enter/Space activation of buttons
   - Verify Escape closes any modals/overlays
3. Test with screen readers:
   - NVDA on Windows (free)
   - VoiceOver on Mac/iOS (built-in)
   - Verify all content is announced properly
   - Check navigation landmarks work correctly
4. Review color contrast:
   - Use DevTools color picker to check ratios
   - Test all text against backgrounds
   - Verify link colors have sufficient contrast
   - Check focus indicators are visible


ISSUE 10.4: PERFORMANCE AUDIT
-----------------------------
Current State:
- Unknown performance metrics
- Need baseline measurements

Resolution Steps:
1. Run Lighthouse performance audit:
   - Test on mobile and desktop
   - Check First Contentful Paint (FCP)
   - Review Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
   - Analyze Total Blocking Time (TBT)
   - Monitor Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
2. Target Core Web Vitals:
   - LCP < 2.5s (good)
   - FID < 100ms (good) or TBT < 200ms
   - CLS < 0.1 (good)
3. Test on slow connections:
   - DevTools network throttling (Slow 3G, Fast 3G)
   - See how page loads on poor connections
   - Identify loading bottlenecks
4. Optimize based on findings:
   - Defer non-critical JavaScript
   - Optimize images further if needed
   - Reduce render-blocking resources
   - Implement code splitting if bundle is large

□ Core Web Vitals pass (LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1)


================================================================================
ADDITIONAL NOTES
================================================================================

1. Backend Integration Postponed:
   - Hardcoded data is acceptable for initial launch
   - Focus on getting UI/UX perfect first
   - Backend integration can be added incrementally later
   - Ensure data structures match future API responses

2. Component Architecture:
   - Current reel-based architecture is solid
   - Focus on refining existing components
   - Extract common patterns as you identify them
   - Maintain consistent patterns across all reels

3. Performance Considerations:
   - Landing page is relatively lightweight
   - Main performance concerns are images and scroll behavior
   - Monitor real user metrics after launch
   - Optimize based on actual usage patterns

4. Accessibility as Foundation:
   - Don't treat accessibility as afterthought
   - Build it in from the start for all new features
   - Test with actual assistive technology users if possible
   - Refer to WCAG 2.1 guidelines for any questions

5. Iterative Improvement:
   - Don't try to fix everything at once
   - Start with critical issues, then high priority
   - Test each fix thoroughly before moving to next
   - Get user feedback early and often
