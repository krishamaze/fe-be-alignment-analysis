# Deployment

## Build

```
npm run build
```

Generates a `dist/` directory containing static assets ready for deployment.

## Hosting

Optimised for static hosts such as [Vercel](https://vercel.com); see `vercel.json` for SPA rewrites.

## Environment matrix

| Environment | App URL | API URL |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| Local dev | http://localhost:5173 | https://finetunetechcrafterp-dev.up.railway.app |
| Staging | TODO | TODO |
| Production | TODO | TODO |

## Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |

## Caching

Serve `dist` assets with longâ€‘term cache headers. HTML should be cached for a short time and serve `index.html` on unknown routes.

## Workflow

1. Push to a preview branch to trigger Vercel preview.
2. Merge to `main` for production deployment.
