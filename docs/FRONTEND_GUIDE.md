## Shop Filters & Sorting

- `Shop.jsx` organizes filters into sections: Sort, Categories, Brands, and Price & Availability.
- Each section uses mobile-friendly spacing; selections feed into RTK Query params and refresh the product grid automatically.

## Home Hero Section

- Uses a brand gradient with a dark overlay to maintain text readability.
- CTAs meet 44px height for accessibility and include clear hover states.
- Displays trust indicators (rating, repairs count, locations) in a responsive layout.
