"""Models for the attendance tracking and management system.

This module defines the database schema for the attendance module, which is
central to tracking employee work hours, shifts, schedules, and leave. It
includes models for:
- **Shifts (`Shift`)**: Reusable shift templates (e.g., "Morning Shift").
- **Schedules (`AdvisorSchedule`, `ScheduleException`, `WeekOff`)**: Rules that
  determine an advisor's expected shift for any given day.
- **Attendance Records (`Attendance`)**: Captures daily check-in/check-out
  times, location data, and status (Present, Absent, Late, etc.).
- **Approval Workflows (`AttendanceRequest`)**: Manages requests for actions
  like manual attendance adjustments or overtime, which require approval from
  a branch head or admin.
- **Payroll (`AdvisorPayrollProfile`)**: Stores payroll-related information
  for advisors.
- **Idempotency (`GenericIdempotency`)**: Prevents duplicate operations for
  critical endpoints like check-in and check-out.

The models are designed to handle complexities such as overnight shifts,
alternating weekly schedules, geofence validation (handled in views), and
automated status calculations. Signals are used to trigger actions, such as
recalculating worked hours when a check-out time is recorded.

Note:
    * Attendance records for an overnight shift use the shift's **start date**
      as the attendance date.
    * Punch durations are rounded to the nearest 5 minutes.
    * A grace period of 15 minutes applies for late check-ins.
    * Half-day threshold is 6 hours (360 minutes).
